# primes

I started reading The Curious Incient of the Dog in the Night-Time today.

It includes the following quote:

"Prime number are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them."

I found that kinda moving, and so prime numbers were on my mind tonight when I was otherwise bored and had free time on my hands. So I did this.

It does not propose to search for a pattern.. only determines the set. I'm sure others have done this, and I suspect even more gracefully than I have. But whatever.
